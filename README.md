# Binomial Expander :)

Finds the expanded form and coefficients of *(a+b)<sup>x</sup>*


Uses custom combination function that finds *n choose k* by using recursion and the ideas behind Pascal's triangle. The function also uses cache to store values that have already been computed to speed up the calculation time.

Any feedback would be much appreciated!
